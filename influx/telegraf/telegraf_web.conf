  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.

  ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of

  ## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
  ## available properties for a device by running:

  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.
  ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
  ## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
  ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
